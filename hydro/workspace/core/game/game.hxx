// SCAFFOLD - ours, no retail counterpart.

// Retail drives frames through VuGameModeManagerImpl and a front end built out
// of VuUI entities. Neither has been transliterated, so this is a deliberately
// thin stand-in whose only job is to load a project and advance the subsystems
// that HAVE been recovered 1:1. It is not a recreation of anything and must
// never be counted as one.
//
// What it does NOT do, because the code that did it was written from
// plausibility and has been deleted: no boat, no handling, no AI, no wake, no
// menus, no water surface assembly, no scene dressing.
